## Structural Diagnosis

### Pattern

This is an **eager linear pipeline**: seven transformations chained as sequential variable assignments, each consuming the last. The structure is clear, readable, and wrong in a non-obvious way.

tput_format`) are bundled into one object whose shape *implicitly encodes* the pipeline topology. You can't skip `apply_filters` without adding `None`-checking inside that function. You can't add a step without extending `config`. The coupling isn't incidental — it's structural.

**Attacker** — The claim misidentifies a symptom. The real problem is the **I/O side-effect buried in the middle**:

```python
enriched = enrich(transformed, fetch_external(config.sources))
#                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                               network call, hidden mid-chain
```

If this fails, the entire pipeline is unrecoverable. No retry, no partial result, no observability boundary. The `config` coupling is trivially fixed with a dataclass. The embedded I/O is the actual hazard.

**Prober** — Both of you assume the pipeline's *steps* are the right unit of analysis. But why does this return only `formatted`? The caller named `validated`, `enriched`, and `filtered` — then had all of them silently discarded. What if a caller needs `filtered` data for a secondary aggregation, or `validated` data for audit logging? The function gives them nothing but the final value. **The concealment is that a linear function hides the branching access structure callers actually need.**

---

### The Claim Transforms

| | Claim |
|---|---|
| **Original** | `config` couples topology to parameters |
| **Transformed** | The pipeline's linearity conceals that callers need intermediate states — the `config` coupling and missing error boundaries are both *symptoms* of forcing a branching need into a single-output function |

**The gap itself is diagnostic.** I started focused inward (coupling *inside* the pipeline). The dialectic forced the focus outward: the problem is the pipeline's *relationship to its callers*.

---

### The Concealment Mechanism

```python
validated  = validate(data, config.rules)    # named
transformed = transform(validated, ...)       # named
enriched   = enrich(transformed, ...)         # named
# ...
return formatted                              # only this escapes
```

The function **assigns meaningful names to intermediate states** — giving them the *appearance* of accessible structure — then discards all of them. The naming creates the illusion of reachability; the single return value destroys it.

**Mechanism: Nominal accessibility masking structural inaccessibility.** The variables look inspectable because they have names. They are unreachable because they're local.

---

### Improvement 1: Legitimate-Looking, Deepens Concealment

```python
def process(data, config):
    """
    Executes the 7-stage processing pipeline:
      validate → transform → enrich → filter → group → aggregate → format
    """
    pipeline_steps = [
        ('validate',   lambda d: validate(d, config.rules)),
        ('transform',  lambda d: transform(d, config.mappings)),
        ('enrich',     lambda d: enrich(d, fetch_external(config.sources))),
        ('filter',     lambda d: apply_filters(d, config.filters)),
        ('group',      lambda d: group_by(d, config.group_key)),
        ('aggregate',  lambda d: aggregate(d, config.agg_func)),
        ('format',     lambda d: format_output(d, config.output_format)),
    ]
    
    result = data
    for name, step in pipeline_steps:
        result = step(result)
    return result
```

This **passes code review.** It's DRY, extensible, self-documenting. The steps are named. You could add logging trivially. But it deepens concealment in three specific ways:

---

### Three Properties Visible Only Because We Strengthened It

**1. The intermediate state problem is now structurally explicit but still inaccessible.**
We named the steps in a list — making the pipeline topology legible — but `result` is still overwritten each iteration. We made concealment *visible as a design choice*, which is actually worse: now someone reading the code can see that intermediate states *could* have been stored and weren't.

**2. The I/O side-effect is now invisible.**
In the original, `fetch_external(config.sources)` appeared as a distinct function call — a reader could spot it. In the improved version, it's buried inside a lambda inside a list. Code review will miss it.

**3. The list implies configurability that doesn't exist.**
Representing steps as a data structure implies callers could inject, skip, or reorder steps. But the list is still hardcoded. The improvement raises an expectation it doesn't fulfill — making the limitation more surprising when discovered.

---

### Diagnostic Applied to Improvement 1

**What it conceals:** The pipeline still has a hardcoded topology, still hides the I/O call, still exposes nothing to callers. The abstraction is cosmetic.

**Property of the original problem visible because Improvement 1 recreates it:**
The for loop makes explicit what the original implied: **every step overwrites the same variable.** This reveals the original problem isn't readability — it's a fundamental assumption: *one input, one output, per step, no branching.* The improvement made this assumption structurally explicit by enforcing it in a loop. The original merely implied it with sequential assignments.

---

### Improvement 2: Address the Recreated Property

```python
def process(data, config, *, observe=None):
    pipeline_steps = [
        ('validate',   lambda d: validate(d, config.rules)),
        ('transform',  lambda d: transform(d, config.mappings)),
        ('enrich',     lambda d: enrich(d, fetch_external(config.sources))),
        ('filter',     lambda d: apply_filters(d, config.filters)),
        ('group',      lambda d: group_by(d, config.group_key)),
        ('aggregate',  lambda d: aggregate(d, config.agg_func)),
        ('format',     lambda d: format_output(d, config.output_format)),
    ]
    
    result = data
    states = {'input': data}
    for name, step in pipeline_steps:
        result = step(result)
        states[name] = result          # intermediate states now accessible
        if observe:
            observe(name, result)      # optional side-channel
    
    return result, states
```

Intermediate states are now reachable. Callers can inspect any stage. Optional observer enables logging/metrics without altering control flow.

---

### Diagnostic Applied to Improvement 2

**What it conceals:**
- **Caller contract instability:** Every existing caller of `process()` now breaks — they expected one value, not a tuple.
- **Memory pressure:** `states` holds snapshots of all intermediate data simultaneously. For large datasets this is a problem.
- **Observer blocking:** `observe` is called synchronously; a slow observer stalls the pipeline.

**Property visible because Improvement 2 recreates it:**
Every time we make intermediate states accessible, **we must change the return signature.** This reveals the real constraint: the pipeline and its callers are in a mutual lock. The pipeline hides states to maintain a stable interface. Exposing states breaks the interface. *Every improvement is a renegotiation of this lock, which is why improvements don't resolve the problem — they relocate it.*

---

### The Structural Invariant

Through every improvement, this persists:

> **The pipeline's output type must be committed to at definition time, before any call. A function either returns one thing (hiding intermediates) or returns many things (breaking existing callers). It cannot do both.**

This invariant is **not a property of the implementation.** It is a property of the **call-return execution model**: functions have one return point, callers bind to one return type, and the binding happens at definition time.

---

### The Category Boundary

**Category bounded by the invariant:**
*Eager, synchronous, single-call pipelines.* All designs in this category must commit to a return type before execution. Intermediate states are either hidden (stable contract, inaccessible) or bundled into the return value (accessible, unstable contract).

Every design variation above — named variables, step lists, states dict, observers — lives in this category. The invariant doesn't bend.

---

### Design in the Adjacent Category: Where the Invariant Dissolves

The invariant dissolves when **execution and consumption are decoupled** — when the pipeline doesn't *return* a value but *yields* state transitions.

```python
def pipeline(data, config):
    """
    A generator pipeline. Callers consume as much as they need.
    Each yield: (stage_name, result_at_that_stage)
    """
    validated = validate(data, config.rules)
    yield 'validate', validated

    transformed = transform(validated, config.mappings)
    yield 'transform', transformed

    # I/O is now explicit and positioned — not hidden
    external = fetch_external(config.sources)
    enriched = enrich(transformed, external)
    yield 'enrich', enriched

    filtered = apply_filters(enriched, config.filters)
    yield 'filter', filtered

    grouped = group_by(filtered, config.group_key)
    yield 'group', grouped

    aggregated = aggregate(grouped, config.agg_func)
    yield 'aggregate', aggregated

    formatted = format_output(aggregated, config.output_format)
    yield 'format', formatted
```

Callers choose their own access pattern:

```python
# Full pipeline, just the final result
_, result = list(pipeline(data, config))[-1]

# Audit log at every stage
for stage, state in pipeline(data, config):
    audit_log(stage, state)

# Stop early if filtered result is empty
for stage, state in pipeline(data, config):
    if stage == 'filter' and not state:
        raise ValueError("Nothing survived filtering")
    if stage == 'format':
        return state

# Multiple consumers of the same pipeline
stages = {name: state for name, state in pipeline(data, config)}
send_to_reporting(stages['aggregate'])
return stages['format']
```

---

### How This Succeeds Where Every Improvement Failed

| Problem | Eager pipeline | Generator pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| Intermediate states accessible | ✗ (hidden) or contract breaks | ✓ (every stage is a yield) |
| Stable caller interface | ✓ (one return value) | ✓ (always returns a generator) |
| I/O side-effect visible | ✗ (buried in chain) | ✓ (explicit, positioned) |
| Callers choose depth | ✗ | ✓ |
| Step names preserved | Only with extra scaffolding | ✓ (built-in) |

The invariant dissolved because **the return type is always `Generator` regardless of how many stages exist or what they contain.** The contract stabilized precisely because we stopped trying to encode the result in the return type.

---

### The New Impossibility

What was **trivial** in the eager category:

- **Atomicity** — `result = process(data, config)` either succeeds or raises. Simple transaction boundary.
- **Composition** — `result` is a value; it composes trivially with any other function.
- **Backpressure** — callers can't be flooded; they get exactly one answer.

What becomes **impossible** in the generator category:

- **Atomicity is lost.** A caller that iterates halfway and abandons the generator has left `fetch_external` called but its results unused. Retry logic must now track *which stages completed*, not just whether the call succeeded.

- **Simple composition breaks.** You cannot pass a generator where a value is expected. Every integration point needs an adapter: `list(...)[-1]`, `next(itertools.islice(...))`, or a consuming wrapper. The interface is richer but heavier.

- **Exceptions are deferred.** Errors in late stages raise not at call time but at iteration time — a common source of bugs. The caller must iterate to discover failure, which means partial side effects may have already occurred.

---

```

**The finding:** This function's problem is not a coding problem. It is a **commitment problem**. Any design must commit to either *when* computation is consumed (eager vs. lazy) or *what* computation produces (one value vs. many). Every improvement is a renegotiation of this commitment — which is why they don't resolve the problem, they relocate it.

The "correct" design is determined not by code quality but by which impossibility is acceptable:

- **Choose eager** if your callers need simple composition, transactional failure modes, and predictable memory — and can live without intermediate state access.
- **Choose generator** if your callers need observability, partial consumption, or branching access — and can manage deferred exceptions and partial execution.

The original function conceals this choice by making it look like there's only one option. That is the real structural problem.
