# Structure First Analysis: The Retry Circuit Breaker

## Initial Claim: The Deepest Structural Problem

   bash run.sh opus task_D1 L8_generative_v2
   bash run.sh sonnet task_H L7_diagnostic
he system could still be failing, degrading, or in cascading collapse. The circuit breaker *gives up on knowledge* and just stops making calls. Then 3 call successes (which could be noise, race conditions, or anomalies) convince it recovery happened. The whole mechanism is: 'stop, wait, guess.'"

### **Attacker (Denies, shifts focus)**
"No. The real problems are mundane implementation bugs hiding under this framework talk. The race condition: state can change between the `if self._state == self.OPEN` check and the retry attempt. The `_success_count` isn't reset consistently. The retry logic hardcodes `max_retries=3` independently of `failure_threshold=5`—these thresholds don't even talk to each other. Fix these bugs and it works fine."

### **Prober (Questions both)**
"But what is 'works fine'? You both assume recovery detection is the goal. What if this is just resource protection—stop calling during outages? Then the timeout is fine. But then why HALF_OPEN? And if you're trying to *detect* recovery: is 3 successful calls actual evidence? Or are you just measuring 'nothing broke the last 3 times'? You're both silent on what success *means*. The gap between you reveals the hidden question: **what are you actually trying to measure?**"

## The Concealment Mechanism

**"Temporal Mystification Through Formalism"**

The mechanism works in three layers:

1. **Formalism creates authority**: The code uses the *language* of a well-known pattern (circuit breaker, state machines, named constants)
2. **Authority hides assumptions**: No reviewer scrutinizes the core assumption because "circuit breaker" sounds like a solved problem
3. **The hidden assumption**: Time passage is causally equivalent to recovery. `reset_timeout` is treated as "the time needed to recover" rather than "the time we'll wait before trying again"

The code doesn't ask: "Is the system healthy?" It asks: "Have we waited long enough?" And it treats the second question as answer to the first.

---

## First Improvement (Deepens Concealment)

```python
def execute(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
    if self._state == self.OPEN:
        elapsed = time.time() - self._last_failure_time
        if elapsed > self._reset_timeout:
            self._state = self.HALF_OPEN
            self._success_count = 0
            self._failure_count = 0  # EXPLICIT RESET
        else:
            raise CircuitBreakerOpenException(
                f"Circuit open. Recovery in {self._reset_timeout - elapsed:.1f}s"
            )  # INFORMATIVE ERROR

    try:
        result = self._retry_with_backoff(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        self._on_success()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        self._on_failure()
        raise
```

**Why this deepens concealment**: 
- The explicit `self._failure_count = 0` looks like correct state management
- The informative error message looks professional and transparent
- Together they make the temporal assumption *even more invisible* by wrapping it in clarity
- A code reviewer sees: "Well-managed state transitions, informative errors" ✓
- A code reviewer doesn't see: "We just renamed 'waiting' to 'recovery' and nobody's checking health"

---

## Three Properties Visible *Only* Through Improvement Attempt

### 1. **Symmetry Breaking**
The original code's mess obscured that failures and successes are tracked asymmetrically:
- On failure: increment count, check threshold, open circuit
- On success in CLOSED: reset failure count (reactively)
- On success in HALF_OPEN: increment count, check threshold, close circuit

The improvement's explicit `_failure_count = 0` at OPEN→HALF_OPEN reveals: **there's no corresponding logic for success carry-over**. Why does failure history reset but success history accumulates? The original code hid this; the improvement exposes it.

### 2. **Hidden Coupling of Concerns**
The reset happens exactly at the temporal decision point (timeout elapsed), which couples "time passed" with "clear failure history." This is invisible in the original (everything is scattered). The improvement makes it visible by cleaning it up—and now you see: **the state transition is a convenient place to hide the assumption that time = recovery**.

### 3. **Observability as Concealment**
The informative error message feels like transparency, but ask: transparency about *what*? It tells you "recovery in 5.2s" but doesn't answer "is the system actually recovering?" Better error messages can *hide* missing information by making the visible information look complete.

## Applying the Diagnostic to the Improvement

**What does the improvement conceal?** 

It recreates the original property: **absence of a recovery signal mechanism**.

In the improvement, you now have explicit state management and clear timing messages. But HALF_OPEN still doesn't ask "is the system healthy?" It asks "have 3 calls succeeded?" These are orthogonal questions.

The improvement makes the state machine *look more principled*, which conceals that the principles are still absent—you've just polished the appearance of rigor.

---

## Second Improvement (Addresses the Recreated Property)

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, reset_timeout=30, 
                 half_open_max=3, recovery_probe_fn=None):
        # ... existing init ...
        self._recovery_probe = recovery_probe_fn
    
    def execute(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        if self._state == self.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self._last_failure_time > self._reset_timeout:
                # IMPROVEMENT: Probe for actual recovery signal
                if self._recovery_probe:
                    try:
                        probe_result = self._recovery_probe()
                        if not probe_result:  # Not recovered
                            raise Exception("Probe failed")
                    except:
                        self._last_failure_time = time.time()
                        raise CircuitBreakerOpenException("Recovery probe failed")
                
                self._state = self.HALF_OPEN
                self._success_count = 0
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenException(...)

        # ... rest unchanged ...

    def set_recovery_probe(self, probe_fn):
        """Provide a function that probes for actual recovery"""
        self._recovery_probe = probe_fn
```

**Why this addresses the property**: It makes recovery detection *explicit and testable*. Before entering HALF_OPEN, you ask "can you even talk?" not just "did we wait long enough?"

---

## Applying the Diagnostic Again (To the Second Improvement)

**What does this improvement conceal?**

It recreates a property of the original: **the dependency on outcome observation**.

You've just changed *which* outcomes you observe (probe results instead of normal call results), but you're still trapped in the **outcome-only category**. The probe itself could:
- Be unrepresentative of real traffic
- Lie (succeed when real calls fail)
- Hide cascading failures that only appear under load

You haven't gained a *causal model* of health. You've just added another outcome to observe.

---

## The Structural Invariant (Persists Through All Improvements)

**"All information about system state flows through observed call outcomes. The circuit breaker has no forward model, no direct observation of causation, only backward-looking results."**

Or more precisely:

> All transitions depend on **observable results of attempted operations**. No transition exists that says "the system is healthy" except "we called it and it worked."

This defines a category: **Outcome-Only Reactive Automata** — systems where every state inference is computed backward from what happened, never forward from what *is*.

---

## The Adjacent Category (Where This Invariant Dissolves)

```python
class HealthModelCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, health_check_fn, health_threshold=0.7):
        """health_check_fn returns a number [0, 1] indicating system health"""
        self._health_check = health_check_fn
        self._threshold = health_threshold
        self._state = "unknown"
    
    def execute(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        # DIRECT observation of health, not inferred from call outcomes
        health = self._health_check()
        
        if health >= self._threshold:
            self._state = "healthy"
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            self._state = "degraded"
            # Refuse to call, based on proactive knowledge
            raise SystemDegradedException(
                f"System health {health:.2f} below threshold {self._threshold}"
            )
```

**Why this escapes the invariant:**

- The invariant required: "All information from call outcomes"
- This design has: direct health observation independent of calls
- You can detect recovery *before* attempting calls
- You can refuse calls *because the system is unhealthy*, not because previous calls failed
- State transitions are forward-looking, not backward-looking

**How it succeeds where improvements failed:**

Every previous improvement was trapped trying to infer recovery from call outcomes. This design *observes* recovery as a property of the system, not as an inference from what happened. HALF_OPEN becomes unnecessary—either the system is healthy enough to call, or it isn't. The state machine collapses to binary decision-making.

---

## The New Impossibility (The Trade-Off)

**In the original category** (outcome-only):
- ✓ Impossible to detect recovery without calling
- ✓ Possible to detect failure cheaply (failure happens during calls)
- ✓ Zero dedicated overhead (failures are free observables)
- ✗ Requires waiting + guessing (timeout + success count)

**In the escaped category** (health-model-based):
- ✓ Possible to detect recovery proactively
- ✓ Possible to refuse calls before they fail
- ✗ **Impossible to have health checks cheaper than actual operations**
- ✗ **Requires a definition of health (what IS health?)**

**The trade-off that defines the escape:**

You've gained the ability to know when to call. You've lost the ability to avoid the cost of knowing. The outcome-only design piggybacks on calls to detect problems. The health-model design requires dedicated observations.

In most real systems: **health checks are as expensive as operations, or more**. You cannot make a free observation of system state. The original design's strength was not attempting this.

---

## The Finding: What the Analysis Reveals

The original code's **deepest structural problem** is not that it's buggy—it's that it solves a different problem than it appears to solve.

- **Appears to solve**: "Detect when a downstream system recovers"
- **Actually solves**: "Stop calling for a while, then try again cautiously"

The circuit breaker pattern language masks this distinction. Every improvement that stays within the outcome-only category deepens the concealment by making the mechanism *look more rigorous* while remaining fundamentally blind. 

**Moving to the adjacent category (health-model-based) doesn't "fix" the original design—it solves a different problem and creates different costs.** The trade-off is invisible until you try to escape, and escaping reveals that the original design's "weakness" (blind waiting) was actually its "strength" (zero overhead).

The structural invariant—outcome-only observation—is not a bug in the implementation. It's a boundary of a design category that cannot be improved without being abandoned.
